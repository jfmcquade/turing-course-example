            Under "A Case Study Approach", the Ofqual case study is introduced. In brief, Ofqual was tasked with
            creating an algorithm to predict GCSE and A-Level grades for students in England and Wales after
            examinations were cancelled during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this video, we use the Ofqual case study to
            illustrate concept on multiple random effects within a data set.

              In the Ofqual example, there's there's variability at multiple levels: You have variability at the school
              level as well as at the individual student level. And so, for different schools there's a natural
              variability there which is not just an effect of a school, but an effect is random in nature. Hence, each
              school has a slightly different effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              In different schools you may also have a different variability within the school. Some schools might have
              a very narrow range of abilities, but might be either a very good school or a very bad school, whereas
              other schools might have a much wider range of students, going from the very good to very bad. And this
              might differ between elite schools, comprehensive schools, struggling schools, and so the variability
              within a school may be different.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ofqual example is a wonderful case where it is clear that the natural variability is living at
              different levels. You've got individual variability on how individuals perform. You've also got
              variability between schools And! there are many other sources of variability within the data that they
              were trying to analyse.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is something where when we're looking at data, we're almost always trying to understand the natural
              variability. But that natural variability could be different for different cases or parts of the data.
              This is one of the difficult aspects: bringing in hierarchical modelling, looking at modelling where there
              are differences between variability between one case and another case. This is one of the areas where we
              think about our models differently Natural variability is not random noise, but here it is structured
              noise. the Natural variability has structure to it.

            For any analysis the question of whether the natural variability related to the problem is purely random or
            has structure should be considered early on. If important structure in the natural variability is not
            considered the associated variability will remain unidentified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hierarchical models capture elements of structure by identifying that natural variability occurs at
            different ‘levels’. Variables corresponding to these levels are often fitted in the model as "random
            effects" rather than "fixed effects".
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also cases where certain subsets of the data have substantially different variability. This might
            be for a variety of reasons such that a subset is more homogeneous in some unidentified way. Another common
            reason with merged datasets could be related to different measurement methodologies. Whatever the sources of
            these differences, the consequence is the same, the analysis can be derailed if they are not identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Large data inevitably contains hidden complexity which can at times derail analysis, through the law
              of
              large numbers. Data scientists can often gain deep insights by analysing strategic targeted subsets and
              comparing the natural variability observed in each case</strong>. Insights gained by breaking the data
            down in this way can often be fed back into a full analysis.

          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>
            In this trial, patients with severe schizophrenia were randomised to receive either an active treatment or a
            placebo. They were followed up for up to 8 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            At weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-randomisation, each patient’s mental state was assessed using a
            validated questionnaire instrument the Positive and Negative Symptom Score (PANSS). The objective of the
            trial was to assess which, if either, of the active treatments could reduce the average value of PANSS by at
            least 20%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 1 shows a data from six individuals in the randomised trial. Time is on the X-axis, and the measure
            of the patients symptom severity is on the Y-axis. On the Y-axis, a lower score is good. There are two sets
            of patients. The patients who received the active treatment are displayed with the dotted lines, and the
            patients on the placebo are displayed with a solid line.
          </p>
          <img src="https://learn.turing.ac.uk/draftfile.php/1490/user/draft/730695902/image.png">
          <p>
            <em>Figure 1: How the symptoms change for six patients over the course of eight weeks. The patients who
              received the active treatment are displayed with the dotted lines, and the patients on the placebo are
              displayed with a solid line.</em>
          </p>
          <h4>Random Variability</h4>
          <p>
            We want to understand the variability in this data. The first distinction to make is that between random
            (natural, "bad") variation and systematic (accounted, "good") variation. We can see accountable variation
            between the two treatments: The solid lines are generally higher than the dotted lines implying that the
            patients on the active treatment are resulting in less severe symptoms than those on the placebo treatment.
            This is good: We would hope that the active treatment would reduce symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also some random variability here, which displays quite a bit of structure. We can peel off the
            different layers to this random variation. A good start is to look at the variation between patients on the
            same treatment, so we can ignore the systematic variation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the three patients who are on the active treatment, one consistently gives higher scores than the other
            two, despite being on the same treatment. This implies some variability between the patients which is
            sustained over the eight weeks of follow up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the jagged lines suggest that there's some random variation in what you actually measure at
            each time point. It seems rather odd to imagine that all of the individual peaks and troughs in these lines
            are real changes in the patients symptom severity. They're just chance occurrences of the particular exact
            time at which that measurement was taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another, potentially more subtle, element of variability in this data is that one of the six patients only
            provided data for the first four weeks. It is not unreasonable to assume, and is true in this case, that the
            patient stopped providing data because they dropped out of the study. And this drop out was not unrelated to
            the medical condition that the trial was intending to study (more on this is discussed in the Missing Data
            content block).
          </p>
          <p>
            To best analyse this data, it is important to understand the different layers of random variation in the
            data, and that it is not just random noise.
