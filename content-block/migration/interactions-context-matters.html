              To illustrate this point, we will use the apple case study on their development of a credit card. When
              developing the credit card, apple were personalising for different things. It's all about personalising
              the application process: People apply for the credit card, and you personalise the product for them. This
              level of personalisation means that they're using interactions all the time: to personalise you feed off
              interactions in the data set.
            </p>
            <p>
              But we now want to go a step further and say, these interactions, if they are there, need to be
              explainable. To do this responsibly, we want to make this explainable.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to be able to not only personalise, but explain how we are personalising. What context is leading
              to these differences? This explainability is big part of understanding the interactions in our data and
              therefore helping us to make those decisions.

            One of the most exciting implications of big data for science is that it has the potential to identify
            complex real world interactions that cannot be found through small studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a growing body of evidence across many scientific domains, including medicine, agriculture and more
            that while traditional research approaches are extremely successful within the context of the study, more
            data is often needed to identify changes in the results across contexts. In health this demonstrates itself
            through recognition that trial participants need to be more diverse than previously understood as both
            gender and race can interact with symptoms and effectiveness. In agriculture there is increasing recognition
            of the importance of interactions with both environmental and cultural factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>As data scientists working with bigger data we are well placed to be able to identify contextual
              differences by studying the interactions between variables</strong>. The nature of data available to us
            often means that there are multiple plausible interpretations to interactions observed which the data cannot
            differentiate between. This is where working collaboratively with people who understand the contexts deeply
            is valuable to guide decisions related to the data.

            The scientific process is about generalising things, and some limitations to this approach have been because
            traditional methods are in within a context. But the big data approaches we have now are across multiple
            contexts - we can have more complexity now.
