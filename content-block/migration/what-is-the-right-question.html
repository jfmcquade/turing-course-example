              What's the right question? What does that even mean?
            </p>
            <p>
              The protein folding example is a really nice case to look at this problem of "What's the right question".
              And this is a great example to say, actually, "What goes right if you ask the right question?" If you
              formulate the question well, and ask the quetion in the right way, then the methods follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this particular case, they did so well at identifying questions that could then be assessed, and
              because they were being assessed relatively independently, the method didn't matter. Therefore, lots of
              different methods could be used and thrown at the problem and assessed independently, and you weren't just
              applying a technique to a problem, but lots of different methods to a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that is what was so wonderful in this protein folding case: They had a whole set of methods thrown at
              it! Different people use different methods, they come at the same problem from different angles. And the
              protein folding example is such a powerful instance where, by clearly defining a question which was of
              importance and asking the right question for what was needed, you can then see which methods are able to
              add value, and are able to move us forward related to this question.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you identify the right question, the methods follow. The methods aren't what's important because the
              question determines every thing. And this protein folding example is a great case to show that.

            AI is a fast moving discipline with researchers rapidly developing new tools and methods. The latest tools
            available are inherently a step forward for use cases related to the specific advances that have been made.
            However, they are often only relevant in the context for which they have been designed, each analytic method
            is able to provide answers to precise questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data scientists benefit from a rich toolbox and from understanding the intricacies of the question they are
            needing to answer so that they can define how to compare and evaluate the usefulness of a wide range of
            analytic approaches for their needs. Some of this comparison can happen based purely on a conceptual
            understanding of methods, but for complex analytic problems there has been success in defining evaluation
            criteria and having teams use different methods to ‘compete’ as part of the comparison process.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to have team members who can bridge the gap between the real question, <strong>the context
              in which the product will be used, and the technical methods which are being evaluated</strong>. It is
            also important for data scientists to understand the range of roles they may be expected to play to
            contribute to building responsible AI products.
          </p>
          <p>
            The need for data scientists with an abstract understanding of a wide range of tools is clear in many cases.
            However this does not negate the value of specialist data scientists who are experts with a specific tool
            and who are part of a broader team working on a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            For bigger projects with competitive comparative processes it is important to limit the competition between
            methods to specific questions as different questions will change the evaluation criteria and hence the
            relative success of the methods.

          <p>
            This video gives a small trailor to the example used in this section on a placebo-controlled trial of drug
            treatments for schizophrenia. This example is used to illustrate the importance of using different methods
            when answering a question.

          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>
            In this trial, schizophrenia patients were randomised to one of three treatments – placebo and two active
            treatments, haloperidol and risperidone – and followed up for up to 8 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            At weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-randomisation, each patient’s mental state was assessed using a
            validated questionnaire instrument the Positive and Negative Symptom Score (PANSS). The objective of the
            trial was to assess which, if either, of the active treatments could reduce the average value of PANSS by at
            least 20%. In Figure 1 are the PANSS results for the 50 patients. Frankly, this visualisation of the data is
            a mess – for good reason, a plot of this kind is called a “spaghetti plot.” Possibly the only thing you can
            see clearly is that there is a general tendency for PANSS scores to decrease over time. So far, so good.
          </p>

          <h4>A model for the PANSS data</h4>
          <p>
            Our visualisation of the PANSS data suggests that the mean response decreases over time, whilst the
            longitudinal context leads us to expect that repeated measurements on the same person are correlated. A
            simple model that captures these features is
          </p>
          <p>
            \[Y_{ij} = \alpha_{k(i)} + \beta_{k(i)} t_j + \gamma_{k(i)} t_j^2 + Z_{ij}\]
          </p>
          <p>
            where \(Y_{ij}\) is the \(j^{\text{th}}\) PANSS measurement on the \(i^{\text{th}}\) person in the trial,
            \(k(i)=1,2,3\) is the treatment allocation, \(t_j = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8\) is the time of measurement
            post-randomisation and \(Z_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\), and the correlation between any two measurements
            on the same person is \(\rho\).
          </p>
          <h4>Two ways to fit the model</h4>
          <p>
            The literature on analysing longitudinal data is extensive, but two of the most widely used methods are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Generalised estimating equations (GEE, Liang and Zeger, 1986)</li>
            <ol>
              <li>In this method, we estimate the parameters of interest, αk and βk, by ordinary least squares but
                adjust the standard errors to take account of the empirical covariance structure of the residuals;</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Linear mixed effects (LME, Laird and Ware, 1982)</li>
            <ol>
              <li>In this method, we estimate the model parameters by maximum likelihood, which guarantees efficient
                estimation under the assumed model.</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Figure 2 displays how both methods perform on the PANSS data.

            <em>Figure 2: The observed mean PANSS scores and the fitted means using generalised estimating equations
              (left-hand panel) and linear mixed models (right-and panel).</em>
          </p>
          <h4>What's going on?</h4>
          <p>
            The two methods are estimating different things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>GEE is estimating the mean PANSS scores at each follow-up time among patients who have not yet dropped
              out;</li>
            <li>LME is estimating what the mean PANSS scores would have been had there been no dropouts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Which is correct? They both are. But you have to know which question you are asking, rather than let your
            method of choice determine the question.
          </p>
          <p>
            As discussed in <a href="https://learn.turing.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25&amp;section=12#section-12">Course
              Overview</a>,
            we can be faced with different causes for missing data. Likelihood-based methods of inference give valid
            results when missingness is Missing at Random – although you may think this small comfort if it isn’t
            estimating what you wanted to estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case you find this puzzling, the cartoon below mimics a longitudinal study in which nobody’s results
            change over time but the higher a patient’s result, the more likely they are to drop out. Consequently, the
            observed mean (i.e. the GEE estimand, indicated by solid dots) decreases over time, whereas the LME estimand
            (indicated by the solid black line), which implicitly imputes the missing values from the observed data, is
            constant.
          </p>

            width="853" height="576">
          <h4>What should we conclude?</h4>
          <p>
            Recall that the stated objective of the trial was to find out which, if either, of the active
            treatments could reduce the average value of PANSS by at least 20%. Using GEE, the estimated percentage
            improvements over the eight weeks of follow-up are 20.0% for haloperidol and 19.5% for risperidone, so
            congratulations to the manufacturers of both drugs appear to be (just) in order.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, the sting in the tail is that the reason most commonly given by patients for dropping out of the
            trial was “inadequate response to treatment.” That suggests to me that results from GEE paint an
            over-optimistic picture. Using LME, the estimated percentage improvements over the eight weeks of
            follow-up are 11.8% for haloperidol and 15.5% for risperidone.
