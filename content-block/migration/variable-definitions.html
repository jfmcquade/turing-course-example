            The common pitfall when merging data is that variables can have different definitions when they come from
            different sources. It is important to check the definition behind the individual variables that you want to
            combine before proceeding with analysis, as well as how the variable was collected. If the variable
            definitions and collection process are consistent, then the analysis can continue as usual. However, if they
            are not consistent, then the data analyst should be aware of potential bias that can be introduced by
            merging the variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            When combining variables from different sources, the data analyst should question whether the variable
            measures the same thing, and has been calculated or collected in the same way for the different sources.
            They
            should make corrections where possible. In addition, suppose that the data analyst finds that the merged
            variable(s) changes for the different sources of data, and the analyst wishes to compare the merged
            variable(s) for the different sources, such as region. The analyst should question whether a potential
            effect has occurred because of a change in definition or collection from the data source, or if the
            potential effect has occurred because of the source variable, such as region.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as questioning and correcting potential biases that can be introduced from inconsistent definitions
            when combining data sets, <b>we recommend adding a new variable that stores the data source, and documenting
            the differences in associated metadata</b>. Then, at least, no information is lost from working on a merged
            variable obtained from different definitions.

              A survey is conducted in four out of ten of these villages shown
              below. The aim of the survey is to determine variables that affect
              the yield of rice. There are five other variables in the resulting
              data set from the survey: village, field, size, fertiliser, and
              variety.

                Field is the field within a village where the crop was grown
              </li>
              <li>Size is a measurement of the field size in acres</li>
              <li>
                Fertiliser is the fertiliser amount. This is a numerical

                Variety is the type of variety of rice - there are three

            Looking at this table, it is clear that the group sizes vary between
            fertiliser group and village; a higher fertiliser is used frequently
            in Nanda, but is never used in the Niko village. This unbalanced
            data leads to the question: is the variability in the yield because
            of a higher fertiliser, or because they’re in that village?
          </p>
          <p>
            An investigation into the data can help clarify the answer. We can
            look at the mean yield by village, and the mean yield by fertiliser
            group.

            We can see that the villages vary in mean yield between them. The
            fertiliser is much more striking. The highest fertiliser level
            results in the largest yield on average, and the lowest fertiliser
            level results in the smallest average yield.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comparing the mean yields with the table of frequencies, we can see
            that villages that use the high fertiliser level more often result
            in a higher mean yield (in Sabey, 6/10 fertiliser levels are high;
            in Nanda it is 9/14). Hence, in this data set, the variation between
            the villages can be explained by another variable: the fertiliser
            level. The unbalanced data then makes village look as if it has an
            effect when fertiliser is omitted from the model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that we are lucky. In other data sets, the variation could be
            down to a variable that isn't measured in the data set, such as the
            soil type or the climate!

        <h3>What can go wrong?</h3>
        <p>
          If we didn’t identify the unbalance in the data, then the conclusions
          could have been very different. An ANOVA is fitted with both
          fertiliser and village as factors. An ANOVA table divides the
          variability into the part that is accounted for, and the residual.
          When the residual variability – the part that is not accounted for –
          is low, then the information from the data becomes clear. In the ANOVA
          table, the mean squares are roughly variances (a common measure of
          variation). If just village is fitted, the village is found to
          significantly affect the outcome variable. The variation between the
          villages is quite large (464) compared with the residual value of 111.
