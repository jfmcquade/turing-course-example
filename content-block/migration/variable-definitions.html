              In 2020, all GCSE and A-Level examinations in England and Wales were cancelled due to the Covid-19
              pandemic. As a result, Ofqual was tasked with creating an algorithm to predict GCSE and A-Level grades for
              students. The approach they used to achieve this is outlined in more detail here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several factors were used to help build the model. The one we are focussing on here is the current
              students' performance in previous qualifications. The students’ performance in previous qualifications is
              referred to as their “prior attainment”. For GCSE level, the prior attainment was taken from the
              individual’s examination results at the end of Key Stage Two, called SATs. For A-Level students, the prior
              attainment was from the students’ performance in their GCSEs.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, in the UK there are multiple GCSE examination boards that schools choose from. Further, GCSEs and
              IGCSEs, which some schools prefer, are not fully aligned in specifications and content. Hence, the GCSEs
              variable has multiple definitions behind it. In the Ofqual algorithm documentation openly available there
              is no mention of any consideration taken to different examination boards, or differentiation between GCSEs
              and IGCSEs for the purpose of prior attainment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the differences between the definitions in this variable, that could give rise to hidden biases due
              to merging these potentially different measurements. If privileged or underprivileged schools consistently
              made different choices, it could lead to unintentional systematic biases from this merging process, which
              would be hard to identify in the predictions. For Ofqual there were other reasons that led to the
              algorithm being dropped, but this is a concrete example of a common problem when working with large
              datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
              When merging variables from different sources, data analysts should be thoughtful to prevent introducing
              biases into the data.

            This is particularly relevant when a data analyst has multiple data sets that come from different sources.
            In
            some instances, it may be sensible to combine, or “merge”, these data sets. This is good practice, and can
            be
            very important for the analysis, but needs to be done thoughtfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            The common pitfall when merging data is that variables can have different definitions when they come from
            different sources. It is important to check the definition behind the individual variables that you want to
            combine before proceeding with analysis, as well as how the variable was collected. If the variable
            definitions and collection process are consistent, then the analysis can continue as usual. However, if they
            are not consistent, then the data analyst should be aware of potential bias that can be introduced by
            merging the variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            When combining variables from different sources, the data analyst should question whether the variable
            measures the same thing, and has been calculated or collected in the same way for the different sources.
            They should make corrections where possible. In addition, suppose that the data analyst finds that the
            merged variable(s) changes for the different sources of data, and the analyst wishes to compare the merged
            variable(s) for the different sources, such as region. The analyst should question whether a potential
            effect has occurred because of a change in definition or collection from the data source, or if the
            potential effect has occurred because of the source variable, such as region.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as questioning and correcting potential biases that can be introduced from inconsistent definitions
            when combining data sets, <strong>we recommend adding a new variable that stores the data source, and
              documenting
              the differences in associated metadata</strong>. Then, at least, no information is lost from working on a
            merged
            variable obtained from different definitions.

            Snakebite has recently been recognised by the WHO as a Neglected Tropical Disease. An apparently
            straightforward question to ask is: worldwide, how many people per year die from snakebite?
          </p>
          <p>
            The numbers of reported deaths per year is available from all affected countries, but different countries
            use different reporting methods: some maintain central records at national or regional level; other rely on
            hospital presentations; still others use sample surveys.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply adding up the numbers could be very misleading. Deaths can be unreported, and the level of
            under-reporting is likely to vary with the reporting method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 1 below shows a world map of available sources of data on snake-bite deaths. Notice how only a few
            countries, notably India, record data at sub-national level. Also, within a relatively small part of West
            Africa, the data from neighbouring countries use different reporting methods.

              <h3>How many Covid-19 Cases?</h3>
              <p>
                The Covid-19 pandemic that burst upon the world in 2020 has generated enormous amounts of data, much
                of
                which is readily accessible from web-sites that collate data from most, if not all, countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I write this (on 9 December 2022), one site tells me that the worldwide number of cases to date
                is
                652,454,528. And if I dig a bit deeper I find, for example, that for the UK, the number is
                24,024,746,
                slightly fewer than Italy’s 24,488,080.
              </p>
              <p>
                The corresponding numbers per 100,000 population are approximately 35 and 40 thousand, respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another site, five minutes later, gives me a worldwide number 648,053,749, UK and Italy numbers
                24,281,031
                and 24,488,080.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s probably not worth agonising too much about the discrepancies between the numbers reported in
                these
                two sites. A more important question is: how do you count the number of cases of a disease whose
                symptoms
                can vary from mild to lethal?
              </p>
              <p>
                I don’t know how they count Covid cases in Italy, but in the UK the headline total is a sum of
                numbers
                reported from several sources. Two government sources are so-called Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 data,
                defined as
                follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pillar 1: “all swab tests performed in Public Health England labs and National Health Service
                  hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers”</li>
                <li>Pillar 2: “swab testing for the wider population” (Department of Health and Social Care UK,
                  2020)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It will be immediately apparent to the reader that testing the population at large (Pillar 2) will
                likely
                detect mild cases that would not fall within the reach of Pillar 2. And even within Pillar 2, the
                underlying disease rates in hospitalised patients are likely to be different from the rates in
                health and
                care workers. In short, the reported number of cases is a biased estimate of the actual number, and
                it is
                not immediately clear how we would quantify, and thus be able to correct for, this bias.
              </p>
              <p>
                The statistically principled answer is to augment the Pillars 1 and 2 data with data from a
                randomised
                survey of the complete population, which will deliver an unbiased estimate but, for reasons of
                affordability, will likely be conducted on a much smaller scale than Pillars 1 and 2 testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two such surveys were conducted in the UK, the REACT survey (REACT Study Investigators, 2020), which
                operated from May 2020 to March 2022, and the continuing Office for National Statistics Coronavirus
                Infection Survey (ONS, 2022). By combining the biased and unbiased data within a single statistical
                model
                in which the randomised survey data “anchor” the Pillars 1 and 2 data, we can estimate and adjust
                for the
                biases in Pillars 1 and 2 data, and get the best of both worlds: an unbiased estimate with higher
                precision than would be obtained from the randomised survey data alone; Nicholson et al (2022) show
                how
                this was done.

                      As a practical exercise, have a look where your country is in the league tables on one of the
                      websites
                      above. At time of writing (December 2022), the total number of cases in Britain is amongst the top
                      ten of
                      all countries and regions considered. Similarly so for the total number of deaths in the UK.

                      countries. At time of writing, they are 25th. In fact, the countries with higher death rates are
                      often
                      very small countries/regions. So, what is going on? Is it that Covid-19 is defined differently in
                      these
                      areas? Is it that Covid-19 is detected differently there?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By comparing rows, we are comparing countries and/or regions to one another. However, there are
                      different
                      mechanisms to detect Covid-19, as well as define Covid-19, depending on the country. In addition,
                      some
                      countries may give their Covid-19 statistics more for political purposes than statistical.

                      However, this doesn’t stop making the comparison, and does not mean that this data is not useful
                      to
                      compare worldwide comparisons. It is important for the data scientist to take the results with a
                      pinch of
                      salt, and to question the data before making conclusions from it. If we wish to compare two
                      countries, we
                      can drill down on the details of these countries a little further. When drilling down, can we
                      learn
                      why
                      some countries are displaying higher counts than others? What can we learn about the definition of
                      each
                      country? How accessible is that countries testing system? In the UK, testing was not available to
                      the
                      public until months after the pandemic began; however, in other countries the testing was
                      available
                      immediately. A spike in the number of cases in the UK therefore may not necessarily signify a new
                      outbreak, but instead that testing was more widespread.

                      In addition, smaller countries tend to have a higher death rate per million. Is the information
                      behind
                      this available? Can we think about why this is?

              Different definitions in data sets are easily overlooked - it's easy to get stuck into the data without
              asking if it means the same thing for different areas, regions, and so forth.
