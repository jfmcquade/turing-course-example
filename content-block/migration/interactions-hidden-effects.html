              We have access to a snippet of the COMPAS data, so can use this data to illustrate interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In COMPAS, a risk scoring algorithm was used to assess a criminal dependence likelihood of reoffending.
              One calculation performed in this algorithm is the violent recidivism scale. This calculation gives a
              score out of 10 aims to predict the criminal dependence likelihood of committing a violent crime after
              their release.
            </p>
            <p>
              A higher score indicates that the individual is more likely to commit a violent crime after their release,
              and hence this person is thought of to be a greater risk for society than an individual with a lower
              score.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are lots of different variables in this data set, but a few to just point out for this illustration
              is
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The priors count, which is the number of prior offences that each that the individual has committed
              </li>
              <li>The charge description. So this is the type of crime committed and the description of the crime and
                this description is of the crime that they face at this particular point in time
              </li>
              <li>Is recid - Whether the individual did end up reoffending or not and</li>
              <li>is violent recid - whether the individual ended up violently reoffended or not.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              So of the individuals who are charged in the data set, 68.6% of them had a prior offence, which already
              suggests that people who have a prior offence are more likely to reoffend again.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we delve into this data, we could see that those who had a prior offence were more likely to reoffend
              than those who didn't have a prior offence. 9.2% versus 5.1%.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can group the criminal charge into whether the charge is a violent crime or a non violent crime
              depending on the description. So of the charges that the individual based 45.7% were charged with a
              violent offence just under half.
            </p>
            <p>
              The proportional defendants charged with a violent crime is similar to those who are charged with a
              nonviolent crime if win 8% less at 7.2%.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what about the defendants, who were both charged with a violent offence and had a series of prior
              offences?An individual may fight, but an individual may face a violent charge as a one off and hence they
              are not a risk to society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, an individual with many misdemeanour charges is not necessarily a a risk to society as well.
              They may simply be part of a community that's at odds with the police.
            </p>
            <p>
              But arguably, individuals who are likely to be offended with the violent crime are a higher risk to
              society than individuals with multiple misdemeanours such as possession or drug charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we can consider how the proportion of individuals that violently reoffended is affected by the
              interaction of prior offence and the charged type of offence that was committed, whether it was violent or
              not.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can immediately see that most individuals fall into the category of reoffending, but not violently.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can look at the data by the proportion of individuals who reoffended violently.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we want to prevent violent crime, because that's the greater business society., looking at the state of
              that difference from 5.2 to 7.9, that's not very big. The chance of a violent crime if you've had a
              nonviolent offence is not so different from the population as a whole. But the chance of reoffending
              violently if you've had a violent offence is greater than the population as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              So finally, we're going to look at this graphic here and this graphic we have our two columns and our
              columns show whether it was a violent offence or not, and our rows show if the individual committed a
              prior offence or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have then got proportions in each of these 44 plots as to whether the reoffence, whether they ended the
              individual ended up reoffending violently.
            </p>
            <p>
              We could see for individuals with no prior offence - pretty much the same proportion of individuals ended
              up reoffending violently for those who were charged with a violent offence as those who are charged with
              nonviolent offence.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the same cannot be said when we look at prior offences. Here we can see that a higher proportion
              of individuals were charged, a higher proportion of individuals reoffended violently if they had received
              that violent charge. Than those who had not received by the charge, and this suggests an interaction.

        <h3>Abstract concept</h3>
        <h4>
          Big data sometimes comes with down-sides as interactions between variables can lead to hidden effects

            When exploring data, a data scientist may find that there is no effect between an explanatory variable and
            an outcome variable. However, the value of this variable may still affect the outcome variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is good practice and important to explore the individual effect between a variable and the outcome.
            However, looking only at the individual effect of a variable on the outcome can be misleading when there are
            interactions. This is especially true if there is structure to the data; for example, with paired data.
            <strong>As such, data scientists should always be conscious of the possibility of interactions between
              variables and, if in doubt, investigate</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A variable may be a predictor for an outcome variable when a second (or multiple other) variable is
            considered. In this case, two phenomena are happening, but are hidden because of the interaction between
            them. Once disentangled, they become clearer.
