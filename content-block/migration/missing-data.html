            <p>
              In 2020, all GCSE and A-Level examinations were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result,
              Ofqual was tasked with creating an algorithm to predict GCSE and A-Level grades for students. The approach
              they used to achieve this is outlined in here, but, in brief, the historical performance of students from
              a previous cohort within a subject and centre is used to help build the distribution of the predicted
              performance of the 2020 cohort within that same subject and centre.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as using historical data for previous cohorts, the current students' performance in previous
              qualifications was also used to help build the model. The students’ performance in previous qualifications
              is referred to as their “prior attainment”. For GCSE level, the prior attainment is taken from the
              individual’s examinations they took at the end of Key Stage Two, called SATs. For A-Level students, the
              prior attainment is taken from the students’ performance in their GCSEs.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, what if a student did not have an observed measurement for their prior attainment? For example,
              if a student previously studied abroad, they might not have a UK-based qualification and hence do not have
              a value for their prior attainment. Alternatively, if a student had changed their name between the
              examination that was used to calculate their “prior attainment” score and 2020, and could therefore not be
              matched in the records.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there were no prior attainment values for all students within a subject and centre, or a high
              proportion were missing within a subject and centre, the predicted distribution for the 2020 cohort is
              based on the distribution of grades from previous cohorts.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a small proportion of students did not have a prior attainment value within a specific subject and
              centre, an additional weighting towards the distribution of grades from previous cohorts within that
              subject and centre would be incorporated into the algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, the algorithm assumed that the missing prior attainment values followed the same
              distribution as the observed prior attainment values. But, what if this was not the case? The values may
              have been missing due to a factor that also would affect their GCSE or A-Level grade that the algorithm is
              predicting. Overseeing this aspect can add biases into the predicted grades for individuals who do not
              have matched data for previous qualifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, consider a student who changed their surname between sitting their GCSEs and A-Levels, in
              2020. It could be a significant event for a student to change their name or surname. It may be that this
              individual is around the age of 18 when they are sitting their A-Levels, in which case the name change has
              occurred at a young age. Has this change that occurred to them to result in a name change affected their
              academic performance positively or negatively?
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, perhaps the student took several years out after their GCSEs before going back to studying
              their A-Levels as a mature student. Has this change that occurred to them to result in a name change
              affected their academic performance positively or negatively?
            </p>
            <p>
              An individual’s prior attainment may also be missing if the student did not sit the examination that was
              used to calculate prior attainment. One example where this may occur is if a student previously studied
              abroad and did not sit SATS or GCSEs. This situation depends on the student, not on how previous years at
              their school have performed. Their situation depends on where they have travelled from and studied
              previously. Was their data that could have been brought into consideration? Should the data scientist be
              looking into that extra data to understand the individual? Or is it okay to ignore that? These are the
              types of questions that the data scientist should consider, because ignoring that is a choice that can
              cause unethical results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, in the UK, independent schools can choose whether their students sit SATS examinations (or have
              any formal examination). Hence, a GCSE student who was at an independent school in year 6 may not have a
              value for their prior attainment score. However, the distribution of grades is not the same between
              independent and non-independent schools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Say an individual studied at an independent school which did not sit any formal examinations in year 6.
              This individual then has a missing prior attainment score. The GCSE grades that they are then given by the
              algorithm depends on the performance of previous cohorts. Their personal situation is not taken into
              account. This highlights the unethical nature of this whole process.
            </p>
            <p>
              As pointed out in the case study, there is an ethical issue with the approach that Ofqual took to
              administer GCSE and A-Level grades. For example, say we did have all the data, that is, we somehow had a
              prior attainment score for an individual whose school happened to not sit formal examinations. Then this
              student is going to be privileged by the algorithm by just attending an independent school since
              independent schools happen to perform better. The whole system is unfair. The individual’s personal
              situation is not taken into account. Hence, there is a problem with the algorithm in the first place. But,
              even by trying to administer grades using this approach, Ofqual did not take into account their approach
              to handling the missing values. This reinforces that not only was Ofqual using this approach badly, but
              doing it well in the first place is totally irresponsible.

            Missing data is inevitable in all but the simplest of datasets. If we think of data as being in a table then
            it is useful to consider rows which correspond to missing cases, columns correspond to missing variables and
            cells correspond to missing values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Missing cases and variables are important for an analyst to keep in the back of their mind. Reflecting on
            missing cases is to think who’s voice is not represented by the data you are using, such as the people who
            don’t use technology, in a social media sentiment analysis. Reflecting on missing variables is to consider
            whether there might be information or metadata which would change the nature of an analysis and hence the
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Missing values, on the other hand, are concrete and any analysis implicitly involves taking decisions about
            them, even if that decision is to ignore them. Make decisions about missing data explicit, with a reasoned
            justification.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How missing values should be handled depends on the context; there is no general right answer, hence
              the importance of justifying your choices</strong>. When faced with missing values, an analyst should
            question why they might be missing, and consider the consequence of the missing values. Which variables and
            cases are incomplete? What proportion of the variable or case is incomplete? Why might these variables or
            cases be missing? Are variables or cases missing in a systematic way?
          </p>
          <p>
            Some missing values can be informative and hence the center of an analysis. In some cases it is possible and
            desirable to estimate missing values while in other cases it is better to leave them out altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            An analyst may be able to use alternative data sources to investigate the cause of missing values and to
            justify their actions when handling missing values. Alternatively, they may be able to discuss with domain
            experts to explore the cause of missingness. This information can inform the analyst to justify their
            actions, even if there is no change. The key point is that the analyst can then be informed, either on the
            causes of missing values, or the impacts of that value being missing.

          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>
            In a climatic analysis, you often have daily data for the rainfall, minimum temperature, and maximum
            temperature. This data is measured at different stations around a country and is useful for many reasons,
            such as for meteorologists in predicting weather patterns. We use the example of climatic analysis to
            highlight how different missingness patterns might stem from different causes of the missing values.

          <h4>Data Detective: All down to context</h4>
          <p>
            In a climatic analysis, you may find there is the occasional missing value for rainfall. We might be tempted
            to assume that this is a completely random missing value, and follows the same distribution as the observed
            rainfall values for the days surrounding it in the data. In that case, we might replace the missing value
            with an observed value on the days surrounding it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, how can we be sure that is the situation? What if instead, the rainfall value was missing because there
            was so much rainfall that day that the whole place was flooded and the person who measures the rainfall each
            day could not access the instrument to measure the rainfall? That would instead mean that replacing the
            missing value with an observed value from the surrounding days results in an underestimate of rainfall.
          </p>
          <p>
            How can we examine the cause of this missing rainfall value? It comes down to context. One approach is to
            talk with experts or read literature in the field to make a more informed decision. In a climatic context,
            there are many weather stations, and satellite data. As a result, in a climatic context, a data scientist
            can cross-reference a missing value with the nearby stations and/or satellite data to see if there was a
            particularly high rainfall that day. Digging into the data is very important when faced with missing values.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if, instead, that despite collecting daily data, there was a whole set of missing data for a month? The
            occasional day missing a measurement could be one reason, but consistently finding there are missing values
            could be for a different reason. This comes down to the context of the situation, and when identifying the
            cause we go into “data rescue”.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this context, the rainfall, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature are initially recorded on a
            sheet and then later computerised.
          </p>
          <p>
            If all three elements are missing, then one cause may be that the sheet is missing and so the data was never
            computerised. In this instance, it is fairly safe to assume that the missing values follow a similar
            distribution to surrounding years for that month.
          </p>
          <p>
            If just rainfall is missing, it could be that the temperature was written up, but the sheet was lost
            ‘overnight’ before getting to rainfall.
          </p>
          <p>
            After speaking with experts in the field, it is apparent that both minimum and maximum temperature are often
            written up together. If minimum temperature is written up, but maximum temperature is not (or vice versa),
            it is almost always the case that the equipment is broken. If the minimum temperature looks similar to
            surrounding stations, it might be possible to “impute” the maximum temperature values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step is always to find the cause. It is then to determine whether to look for it, and, if you can,
            to then restore it.

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>
                The National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) manages blood donation services in England, and
                transplant services across the UK. One data set supplied by NHSBT contains the survival times of 7732
                patients following a kidney graft, with the transplants taking place between 2001 and 2008. As well as
                survival time, other variables in the data set detail characteristic information on the donor and
                recipient of the kidney transplant, the transplant itself, and the outcome of the transplant.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this data set, 66% of rows contain at least one missing value in their variable. One variable in
                particular, weight, contains a high proportion of missing values (59.8%).
              </p>
              <h4>Handling Missing Values</h4>
              <p>
                To know how to handle the missing weight value, we need to know why it is missing. We can hypothesise
                many reasons for this, three examples are:
              </p>
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Scenario I: A random selection of individuals who get their weight measured find that the machine is
                  not working at that time</li>
                <li>Scenario II: Older individuals did not consent to having their weight taken</li>
                <li>Scenario III: Certain individuals who had a larger weight did not consent to disclosing their
                  weight.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                The cause of the missing weight value impacts how we handle the missing data. For example, if it were
                Scenario I then we can assume that the missing values follow the same distribution as the observed
                values. However, if it were Scenario III then ignoring the missing values can add bias into the analysis
                if weight did affect the outcome, since we would be treating individuals the same regardless of their
                weight. This would mean some variation is unaccounted for.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are lots of techniques to help determine why data is missing which go beyond this course. But, to
                illustrate, one approach can be to look at the distribution of another variable split by whether weight
                is observed or not. In Figure 1, we look at the weight of the recipient of the transplant split by
                whether they had their weight missing or observed. This indicates that the cause of missing in the data
                is Scenario II: The data is more likely to be missing for individuals who are older.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hence, when we think about handling the missing values, we should look at the relationship between
                weight and age. If there is a correlation between weight and age, then the missing values are more
                likely to follow a distribution of the observed weight values for older individuals than for the younger
                population.

            <p>
              Ignoring missing values is a decision made by the analyst. Like any decision that the analyst makes when
              handling a data set, it is important to justify their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When faced with missing values, an analyst may be able to use historical data, or previous studies, to
              investigate the cause of missing values and justify their decision when handling missing values.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, Ofqual could have used historical data to see the performance for a student who changed their
              name between qualifications, but were still identifiable. In this analysis, they can see:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the distribution of grades were similar between students who later changed their name to those who
                did not change their name for the qualification used to calculate “prior attainment”.</li>
              <li>If the distribution of grades were similar between students who changed their name to those who did
                not change their name for the qualification the algorithm was trying to predict.</li>
              <li>The change in performance for individuals who changed their name between qualifications against those
                who did not.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              This can reduce the bias in the results.
